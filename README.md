# HSVDDCT (Hybrid Singular Value Decomposition-DCT)
Image-coding algorithm which combines the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and the singular value decomposition (SVD). 
The DCT is used to transform those blocks in the source image that exhibit a high correlation, 
while blocks with greater high-frequency content are transformed using the SVD.
